# Project Overview
In this project, I will gather data from a variety of sources and in a variety of formats, assess its quality and tidiness, then clean it. This is called data wrangling. I documented my wrangling efforts in a Jupyter Notebook, plus showcase them through analyses and visualizations using Python (and its libraries). 

## Project Steps Overview
+ Step 1: Gathering data

+ Step 2: Assessing data

+ Step 3: Cleaning data

+ Step 4: Storing data

+ Step 5: Analyzing, and visualizing data

+ Step 6: Reporting: data wrangling, data analyses and visualizations

## What do I need to install?
I will need an installation of Python, plus the following libraries:

* pandas
* NumPy
* Matplotlib
* csv
* requests
* tweepy
* json


## Dataset
The dataset that I will be wrangling (and analyzing and visualizing) is the tweet archive of Twitter user [@dog_rates](https://twitter.com/dog_rates), also known as [WeRateDogs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WeRateDogs). WeRateDogs is a Twitter account that rates people's dogs with a humorous comment about the dog.


## Summary of Findings

The goal of this project was to wrangle, analyze and visualize a dataset. After answering some questions based on the dataset, we can make the following conclusion:

+ Charlie was the most popular dog name, with a total of 11. With a total of 10, the names Oliver, Cooper, and Lucy were close behind.
+ Pupper has the highest percentage among other dog stages with a share of 66%, while Floofer has the lowest percentage among other dog stages with a share of 2%.
+ The retweet count and favorite count have a positive correlation (0.91). This indicates that both parameters have a linear relationship.
+  WeRateDogs had a very successful month in terms of retweets in June of 2016, with over 7,000 retweets.
